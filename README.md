<h1>About C++ Programming</h1>
--> C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.<br><br>
--> C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.<br><br>
--> C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.<br><br>
--> C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.<br><br>

<h2>Class</h2>
--> The building block of C++ that leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class.<br><br>
--> It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class.
--> A class is like a blueprint for an object.<br>

<h2>Object</h2>
--> An Object is an identifiable entity with some characteristics and behavior.<br><br>
--> An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.<br>

<h2>Data Abstraction</h2>
--> Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important features of object-oriented programming in C++.<br><br>
--> Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details. <br>

<h2>Data Encapsulation</h2>
--> In normal terms, Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up data and information under a single unit. <br><br>
--> In Object-Oriented Programming,Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulate them.<br>

<h2>Polymorphism</h2>
--> The word polymorphism means having many forms. <br><br>
--> In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. <br>

<h2>Inheritance</h2>
--> The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance.<br><br>
--> Inheritance supports the concept of “reusability”, i.e. when we want to create a new class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that we want, we can derive our new class from the existing class. <br>

<h2>Dynamic Binding</h2>
--> In dynamic binding, the code to be executed in response to the function call is decided at runtime.<br><br>
--> C++ has virtual functions to support this.<br><br>
--> Because dynamic binding is flexible, it avoids the drawbacks of static binding, which connected the function call and definition at build time.<br>

<h2>Message Passing</h2>
--> Objects communicate with one another by sending and receiving information.<br><br>
--> A message for an object is a request for the execution of a procedure and therefore will invoke a function in the receiving object that generates the desired results.<br><br>
--> Message passing involves specifying the name of the object, the name of the function, and the information to be sent.
